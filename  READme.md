# VBA_Challenge 
VBA of stock market data.

#Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
# Files 
Downloud the following files to help you get started:
!{Module2 Challenge files}(stockmarket.excl)

## Instructions
* Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
   * The ticker symbol
  
   * Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
   * The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
   * The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:
  !(modereate_solution)(Images.png)

   * Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:
   !(modereate_solution)(immages.png)

   * Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Note 
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. 

### Other Consuderations

* Use the sheet  "alphabetical_testing.xlsx"  while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.
  
* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
